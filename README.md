## Counting Counter

Preview: https://counting-counter.surge.sh

Web Application with nice landig animation (wait for it few seconds), hosted on surge, based on React and Firebase with use of:
- Redux.js
- moment.js
- other npm packages listed in package.json

Main functionality is setting counters with name, time and message. Then you can display remaining time in few formats, and after time is up, read the message. You can also filter the counters and delete them.

Purpose of creating this app, was to refresh my knowledge. Despite of few bug, due to lack of time, Counting Counter app won't be rather developed anymore.
